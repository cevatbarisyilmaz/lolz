# LOLZ
LOLZ is an interpreted, esoteric programming language that only accepts letters 'l', 'o' and 'z'. See [wiki page](https://github.com/cevatbarisyilmaz/lolz/wiki) for detailed tutorial.
## A Quick Rundown What LOLZ Tries to Achieve
### Be Funny
Well, at least pretending to be funny. That's still something. What other language lets you to build a software while writing "loolz" all the time?
### Save Your Job
Once you find a job in a company uses LOLZ, chances are that you will never be fired as long as they keep using LOLZ since the next guy hired will have 0 chance to maintain your code, while you still have that 1%.
### Get Rid of All The Error Handling Headache
Who even likes trying to catch all the exceptions falling down everywhere? There is none of it in LOLZ. Because LOLZ does not have any exceptions or errors of any kind, including parsing errors. Even division by 0 cannot disturb the peaceful flow of the program.
### Keep It Simple
LOLZ only has one data type -why would you need anything else when you have strings?!- and 3 functions. So you don't have memorize all the function signatures or try to find out which types are compatible with each other.
### Make Everything One-Liner
Since LOLZ does not care about newlines or semicolons, you can write whole programs using just one line, well, except that one line may turn out to be a pretty long one.
## Some Sample Programs
